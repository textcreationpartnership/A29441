            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A Brief Diſcourſe</hi> Betwen a Sober Tory and a Moderate WHIGG.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>TRuly Neighbour <hi>Whig,</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a very good Eſteeme of you, and I think in my Conſcience a great many of you called <hi>Whigs,</hi> are very honeſt well-meaning People, but that you are ſo thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uneaſie in matters of Government: which in my opinion very ill becomes a good man, or a true Chriſtian.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you Neighbour <hi>Tory,</hi> for your kindneſs. But what mean you by ſaying that we are uneaſie in matters of Government; you know that I have always been as well ſatified with and as much admired our Government; both in Church and State, as any man whatſoever: and were I to have my wiſh. I would only deſire that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts might be a little better Regulated and the Deſſenters (whether Scrupulous, or Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born) a little more mildely dealt with; and the many good Laws we have, more ſtrictly put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that ſo we might be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſecured from the cruel deſigns and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous practiſes of thoſe Blood-ſucking Monſters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory</speaker>
               <p>Why Neighbour, you cannot forbear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering your diſcontent immediately, you are now for conniving at the Fanaticks, and abating the Rigour of the Law againſt them, and for Proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with the greateſt extremity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſee that ſome of our admired Miniſters of Juſtice Act quite contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Whatever the Miniſters of Juſtice do, you know it was the Opinion of the four laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, after their moſt deliberate Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Diſſenters ſhould not be ſo Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently proſecuted on the Penal Laws: And they were for repealing ſome of the moſt harſh Laws againſt them becauſe they were not willing it ſhould be in the Power of every malicious, troubleſome fellow, to proſecute them thereupon, to their utter Ruine; as we have ſeen it in many parts of the Nation. Beſides they thought that the Proſecuting them ſo furiouſly at this Juncture. was a means of giving the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the greater Opportunities of Effecting their Villanous Diſigns. And of eſcaping the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which the Laws moſt Juſtly pronounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Neighbour will you be ſo great a <hi>Whig</hi> as to Rely upon the Actions, and Opinions of the late Parliaments, The Extravigancy and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of whoſe Intentions, his Majeſty hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently made known to the world in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And the Nation in general by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and Abhorrencyes have fully Declar'd their deteſtation of their Proceeding.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Neighbour, the Parliament being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (or ſhould be) a number of men, Generally of the Eſtates, and greateſt Prudence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in their ſeveral Countreys; whilſt their Actions tend to the Conſervation of our Laws, and the Maintenance of the Kings Royal Authority, and our Eſtabliſhed Religion, I know not on whom <hi>I</hi> may better Rely. And if they did Vote any thing that may ſeem extraordinary, <hi>I</hi> think we ought to impute it to the Exigency of the Times, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of affairs as they then ſtood; for they (<hi>I</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) well enough ſaw that whilſt the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Counſels were ſo prevalent, they were only Deluded, and ſhould not be ſuffered to do any thing that might effectually ſecure the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and their Deſigns. And for the Addreſſes, and thoſe kind of things you ſpeak of, we believe in moſt <hi>Towns</hi> they were Propoſed, and carried on either by Perſons <hi>Popiſhlike</hi> affected, or elſe by thoſe who by their intereſt were bound and obliged to ſuch; and they procured ſome, of the ſame Inclinations with them, and ſome of the <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> Vulgar, to ſubſcribe them; and then called it an Addreſs from ſuch a <hi>Town,</hi> or <hi>County</hi> whereas we belive there were very few Subſcribers of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Sobriety amongſt them. Not but that all good men will be ready to Addreſs, or do any juſt thing, that may be acceptable to his Majeſty; but they thought they could not juſtly endeavour to Reflect, or caſt an <hi>Odium,</hi> upon the late Parliaments, who were ſo Sollicitous and concerned for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties and Nations good. But let us return to our Diſſenters and <hi>I</hi> proteſt Neighbour did they preach ſuch abominable and <hi>Helliſh</hi> Doctrines, or Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe and Juſtifie thoſe Horrid Villanies, Butcheries, and Murders, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (as is manifeſtly known to all the world) to, <hi>I</hi> ſhould then be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegether as Zealous for proſecuting them, as <hi>I</hi> am now for Proſecuting the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>Have you them forgot that Bloody War, that was begun by them, even in our memory, and that moſt abominable Nefarious deed, the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late King. Sure when you look back on what was then done by them you will have very little to ſay in their excuſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>As for the Original of that Unnatural War, we cannot lay the blame of it only on the Diſſenters: if you examine the true Hiſtory of thoſe Times, you may find that there were great Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers growing in the State many Years before the breaking out of that War. And perhaps many that were no Diſſenters from our Church, may as juſtly been tilled to the Original of it as the presbiteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelves: and for that moſt execrable, and moſt horrid deed, the Murther of his late Majeſty;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56715:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>we believe it was perpretated by a number of men, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a moſt bloody. War had gotten the ſole power of affairs into their own hands; and thought it Impoſſible for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſafe, without committing that abhorred Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for which we have ſeen moſt of thoſe of them that were taken Recieve their moſt juſt demerits, and we know that many of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were as much Concerned for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that Fact, and Declared as great an abhorrency of it, as any. And I think they of late have Sufficiently De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the World, that they have no Inclination to Rebellion, or diſloyalty when as they being ſuppoſed in many places the Superior Number, have taken ſo patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe Notorius abuſes from their Inveterate Enemies; &amp; have plaineough underſtood their Malicious Deſigne of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all thoſe you call <hi>Whigs,</hi> Odious to the World. How have <hi>Papiſts</hi> and their Secret Friends, continually endeavour'd to throw of the Guilt of their accurſed <hi>Plot,</hi> from themſelves upon many of his Majeſties good Subjects, whom no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſon upon du con ideation can poſſibly believe guilty of thoſe things whereof they are accuſed they have ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and inceſſantly followed theſe Methods, that amongſt moſt of thoſe you call Loyal, and well Effected to the Crown the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> is almoſt exploded, and Laught at; and ſome of the Witneſſes (whom never could Diſprove, I think in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one thing they Teſtified) Villified, and reproached as the Worſt of men; to the great Scandal and Diſgrace (in my Opinion) of the Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>Come Neighbour, do not be over cofident of any mans Innocency: Time you know is the Mother of Truth, and ſhe may perhaps ſhortly produce thoſe things that may ſatisfie you of the Guilt of ſome perſons; which you cannot I percieve get credit, Notwithſtanding thoſe notorious things that have been by ſo many Witneſſes teſtified agrinſt them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Were there any Circumſtances Concurring with their Evidence, I ſhould not be ſo unbeliving: but ſince after ſo long a Time of Preparation, they could make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear no better on their parts than it did; I cannot do any perſon that wrong as to believe him Guilty of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable and impracticable Deſigns, in the mean time that any Mans Life, Honour, Eſtate, and the Good of his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould upon falſe or frivolous Suggeſtions, be brought into that apparent hazard of being Forfieted, and Loſt, I think is nor one of the leaſt of injuries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>Prithe Neighbour <hi>Whig,</hi> ſince you and I differ ſo much in our Judgments about theſe things, let us not talk more of it. But I am of Opinion, that if you, and others of your Inclination, did but give more heed, and credit to ſome of our Learned, Divines you would not ſo ſollicitouſly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your heads about <hi>Popery.</hi> for they moſt piouſly tell us, that we ought to commit the Event of thoſe things to the Almighty, who will undoubtedly take care of his own Truth That Prayers and Tears to God, are the only Lawful means we have to Defend us from <hi>Popery,</hi> and that if it pleaſes God, as a Puniſhment for our ſins, to ſuffer it to be Eſtabliſhed over us, all our Endeavours againſt it ſhall be Ineffectual: and that if a falſe Worſhip ſhould be ſet over us, we ought to ſhew our Faith and Love to the Truth, in ſuffering for it under their Power, but not in Reſiſting, or Endeavouring Forcibly to maintain the Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks they might allow us to petition and, ſue to our earthly Prince alſo, as well as to God Almighty, to be delivered from that Intollerable Bondage of <hi>Popery,</hi> and other dangers that threaten us. But therein they think we are too preſumtuous and tho they find none but ſuch mild wayes, Oppoſeing <hi>Popery,</hi> they have other <hi>Weapons</hi> than Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Tears, <hi>(viz)</hi> ſevere Laws, to uſe againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants: and ſhould they ever engage in half the Villanie the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do; (which God forbid, and I hope ther's no fear they ſhould) they would find <hi>Axes,</hi> and <hi>Halters</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to uſe againſt them and they inveigh againſt them, and Revile them ſo bitterly, as if they already thought the uſe of thoſe Impliments too long forborne; altho' our Laws Provide no ſuch Puniſhment againſt thein; but againſt all thoſe that acknowledg a forreign Juriſdiction, or take orders from the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> they do. And I proteſt Neighbour no thing in the World is to me a greater Miſtery, than to fee and conſider, how ſtrangly many of our Divines (whom I ought in Charity to believe far enough from <hi>Popery</hi>) behave themſelves in this Point.</p>

And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Neighbour <hi>Tory,</hi> I think we are Highly accountable to Almighty God, for our Neglect if we all do not colour ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to defend the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion as it is now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> and to Oppoſe <hi>Popery,</hi> for how can we expect Pardon at the hands of God, if we tamely ſuffer his Truth to be rooted out from among us, and ſomthing introduc'd in the place of it, that ſhall bear the name of the Doctrine of of the Goſpel of Chriſt, but patroniſe under that fair, and glorious name, the Worſt of Villanies, and abominable crimes that either Pagans, or Mahometans, would bluſh to heare of. And tho the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may impudently deny this, yet it's eaſie enough to prove it out of the <hi>W. N.</hi> things of many of their eminent men by their Cannons, Bulls, Decretals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, their Conſtant Practiſe. I am ſorry to ſay this of them for there are many of them I know fine Gentlemen, and men of an extraordinary Sweetneſs, and pleaſantneſs of humour. but if we look on theſe men in their Religious Capacity, and as they are ſet on by their <hi>Prieſts;</hi> tho they are of ſo ſweet amicable, and friendly Temper, yet would they cut mine, and a thouſand <hi>Hereticks</hi> Throats, to advance the Holy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique Cauſe; ſo that they muſt Degenerate from being men and become Barbarous, ſavage, and Inhuman that ſo they may be True Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>You are very Violent Neighbour, againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> and I hope you believe worſe of them then indeed they are. But have a care of talking as you do of Oppoſeing <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> for if a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince Should ever come to Feigne over us, can you believe he would Eſtabliſh the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it is now Enacted by Law, which is a Crime ſo black, and Odious, that every <hi>Papiſt</hi> that hath the leaſt ſpark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Honeſty, will be very careful to Avoid.</p>

               <p>I doubt not Neighbour, but that I have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd my ſelf with as much I Loyalty, as you, or any other <hi>Tory</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and have as deep a Senſe of nay Allegiance, and Duty to my natural and Lawful Prince, as the Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Subject of you all. I own it to be a thing moſt wicked, and Dishoneſt, to Oppoſe or Rebel againſt my Lawful Prince And I believe the Subjects ought by all Lawful ways, and means to look after the Converſation of their Laws and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. And as for <hi>Popery;</hi> I proteſt Neighbour, I think you and I, and all True <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, ought to Oppoſe it to our utmoſt power, and to adventure our lives, and fortunes againſt it, at any time, whoſoever they are that openly, and forciebly endeavour to introduce it upon us. For my part I declare, I had rather be cut in pieces in the <hi>Field</hi> if fighting againſt it, that to be brought to the Stake at any Time, under it's power. And I think I acquit my duty to God, and my Country beſt in ſo doing. But if it pleaſes God, after we have done what we can to prevent it, to ſuffer it to be Eſtablished over us, then is the time (I think) for us to shew our faith, in ſuffering under it.</p>

               <p>Neighbour, I cannot be ſatisfied in my Judgment that I may Lawfully, Oppoſe <hi>Popery.</hi> For there is no crime. I would more Cautiouſly Shun than Rebellon. And ſince the <hi>Nation</hi> ſtands in ſo Hazardous condition, let us all pray that God will be pleaſed long to preſerve his preſent Majeſty to Reign over us, Dureing whoſe time we may expect Peace, and Tranquillity, to be continued amongſt us.</p>

               <p>I <hi>Heartily</hi> beſeech God to grant him many and happy days, and that not only becauſe our happyneſs and ſecurity Depends upon his Life, but becauſe he is my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Lawful Prince, and as he is ſo we ought to pray for &amp; endeavour, his happineſs, &amp; poſterity cut of that natural Love and allegiance that we ought to bear to him.
